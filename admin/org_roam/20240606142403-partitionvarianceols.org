- Page 193 "We can be reasonably certain that the figure of 60% overstates the dependence of A on x (A is the dependent variable).
- "Thus there are a great many other indicators of the X's that might have been included ... and the included x's are serving not only measure themselves but also act as partial proxies for all those other x's that might have been included"
- Then also our original set of X's may have been incomplete
- Then, too, least squares picks up various random fluctuations in the right direction to help out the x's and gives the x's credit for those.

 I don't think he really develops the maths.

- Dr. Hoaglin advocates the phrase “adjusting for” instead of “controlling for” whenidentifying concomitant covariates in discussion of the interpretation of a particularcovariate of interest.
- 1) added-variable plots; 2) examination of coefficients in multivariate normal distributions and the geometry of leastsquares; and 3) proper application of multivariable models requires caution in calculating predictions that average over other variables
- "In section 4, Dr. Hoaglin cautions against the “holding other covariates constant”phrase when interpreting a coefficient associated with a variable that enters the model in multiple ways either as part of an interaction or in an additional function form as is the case in polynomial models. All authors (of texts to which I had access in mybookshelf) go to great lengths to cover interpretation in such models, and none of them advocate using this phrase in those instances."
-  At worst, “held constant” is a placeholder with which we have become a little too comfortable. That phrase is a nod toward the fitted model and the model’s underlying assumptions.

States we only care about regression when the predictors are correlated

But "in the presence of multicollinearity, it becomes challenging to determine the individual effect of each predictor variable on the dependent variable.
