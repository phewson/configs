NTS Technical Report 2003-2004

Section 8.2 Page 176 (184 of pdf)
- SRS not possible (costs)
- Hence stratified sampling.
    - PSU (Primary sampling unit): one or a small group of postcode sectors. PSUs are usually more homogenous so the error "is greater".  "Offset to some extent by the sampling frame"
- Sampling errors can be calculated for all estimates, however multilevel structure makes this more complex.
 - First two digits of PSU identify major strata, next three form minor strata.

   $SE(r) = \sqrt{ \sum_{pair} \frac{a}{a-1)x^2 \sum_{i=1}^a (z_i - \bar{z})^2 }$

    -  r: statistic being considered (mean or proportion),
    - a, number of psus,
    - $y_i$ sum of statistic in PSU $i$,
    - $x_i$: sample size in PSU $i$,
    - x: $\sum x_i$,
    - $z_i$: $y_i - r x_i$,
    - $\bar{z}$ minor strata mean

This looks like work on one of the older NTSs
