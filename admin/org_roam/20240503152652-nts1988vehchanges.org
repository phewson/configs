- Previously, all vehicles available to the household at any time were counted as household vehicles
- This could lead to double counting (one car household replaces car mid-week)
- Overestimates by 1-2% and exaggerates number of new cars
- Primary vehicles belong to household at start of week
- Secondary vehicles are retained solely for purposes of understanding travel stages, but not analysed as if they belonged to the household
- New questions on exact date of acquisition added from 1995
