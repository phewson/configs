#+title: ReflectiveMarking


Intro: 16/20

Technical challenges (21/30)


Personnel challenges (22/30)
Presentation (14/20)


- Introduction (20 marks)

 

• The overall aim of the placement, including a description of the company’s structure
and operations and an explanation of how the placement opportunity and work
undertaken develops and extends your particular interests, skills and supports your
career intentions.
• Specification of the particular task(s) you were charged with on the placement,
including a clear description of a ‘problem(s)’ or challenge(s) you tackled.
II.- Technical Challenges (30 marks)


• A clear outline of the strategy you employed to address the problem or challenge
revealing how you have applied problem-solving skills and knowledge from your
discipline area (link to the specific technical contents from specific modules you
would have taken including module code). These are technical challenges and you
must show how you applied discipline knowledge and expertise to solve them.
• An evaluation of your strategy which should determine and reveal your effectiveness
in resolving the problem or challenge and makes recommendations for future
enhancements. You should critically assess the professional technical skills you
gained/developed during your internship.
III.- Interpersonal skills and workplace challenges (30 marks)
• This section will enable you to identify and reflect on interpersonal workplace
challenges and particular events which you consider to be noteworthy whilst
undertaking your placement. For example, a difficult boss, unrealistic expectations,
co-workers plotting against you, sexism/racism/cultural challeges.
• These are not technical problems, but rather “soft” challenges that arise from
office/workplace interaction, conflict, work deadlines, etc.

• The idea behind selecting and reflecting on these particular events is that you should
be able to consider them in the light of the discipline-related and personal skills
which you will have brought to the placement and also how they have helped
develop these and new skills in the workplace setting. Your journal should help you
to identify the critical incidents you want to write about.
• Reflection should be a critical process and you should be able to articulate your
thoughts, ideas and perspectives to convey the process of learning which occurred
during the placement. Write about what you were thinking at the time.
IV.- Presentation (20 Marks)
• An appropriate professional presentation, layout, style, and readability – failure to
keep within the maximum word count (4000 words will be penalised by 5 marks.
• Make sure you pay attention to the typography and data graphics videos.




Clarity of purpose and structure (10-20%)
Clear objectives: does the student clearly outline the purpose of the reflective account? Are the main points of reflection clear?
Logical Structure: Is the account well organised with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion? Does the flow of the account make sense guiding the reader through their reflection?
Focus on reflection: Ensure the account stays focussed on self-reflection rather than turning into a purely descriptive or academic piece

High marks: well organised and easy to follow, clear purpose.
Low marks: Lacks structure or purpose, disorganised

Depth of reflection (30-40%)
Critical reflection. Does the student go beyond mere description of events.  Are they critically analysing their experiences, thoughts and feelings?
Learning from experience: Do they reflect on what they have learned and how it influenced their personal or academic development
Self-awareness: Does the student demonstrate self-awareness, acknowledging strengths, weaknesses and areas for growth
Insight: Does the reflection provide any deeper insights into their learning or behaviour

High marks: deep critical analysis of the experience showing insight and self-awareness
Low marks: surface level reflection with minimal analysis or self-critique

Connection to theory or concepts (20-30%)
Integration with academic knowledge: Does the student relate their experience to relevant theories, models or concepts learned in their course
Use of evidence: Are academic ideas applied appropriately to support or challenge their reflections

High marks: effective use of theory to support reflection demonstrating a strong understanding of course material
Low marks: Little or no connection to academic concepts or misapplication of theory

Personal and Professional Development (20-30%)
Personal growth: does the student identify how the reflection has helped them grow either personally or professionally
Plans for future development: Has the student outlined how they will apply what they learned to future situations or work
Changes in attitudes/actions: Does the account show evidence of changing attitudes, behaviours or skills as a result of the experience

High marks Demonstrates clear personal or professional growth with actionable plans for the future
Low marks: little evidence of development or no plans for the future

Writing quality and presentation
Clarify and cohesion: Is the writing clear. concise and well articulated. Does it stay focussed and coherent throughout
Grammar and spelling
Propper referencing

This document applies to the academic year 2023/24
MTH3100 assignments and marking guidelines 2023/24
Module leader: Prof Mark Baldwin
Updated August 2023
Summative Assessment: Due date
Journal 15% 13.9.2024
Employer’s Report 10% (not marked. 10/10 if turned in) 13.9.2024
Technical Report 60% 13.9.2024
Poster 15% 20.9.2024
MTH3100 was a new module in 2021/22. As module leader, I learned a lot about what
works well and what does not. Early due dates do not work well. Student placements can
run June–June, September–September, or even June–September. Accordingly, most
assignments are due 13 September 2024. This gives you the maximum time to work on your
submissions, and also allows some time for the Department to progress you to the next year
by mid-October, which is required. This date allows for students to request extensions (up
to two weeks) to the due date. The date for poster submission is 20 September 2024, and
the poster session will be timetabled for the first half of October.
Note: The ELE page will have links to recorded lectures on the following topics: how to do a
presentation, how to make figures, how to write a report, how to format a report, how to
cite references, etc. Live lectures are not possible since you will be on placements.
Make sure that you learn from the videos. The markers will know if, for example, you did
not learn about typography.
Journal. 15% of total module mark.
A journal reflects your thoughts as you progress through your placement. It should contain
what is important to you. Typically, this includes reflection on problems, work issues, being
treated well or unfairly, and how you plan to resolve issues. There is no limit on the number
of words, but more words will not automatically earn higher marks. 2000-3000 words is
plenty. You may choose to submit scans of your handwritten journal, as it was originally
written. Or you may choose to create a document. The marking criteria are flexible. Markers
are looking for evidence that you kept a journal as your placement progressed, and that it
was useful to you. The journal is not a log of number of hours worked each day, or just facts.
It is not a summary of what happened. It is a record of your thoughts.
