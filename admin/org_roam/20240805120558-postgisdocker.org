#+title: PostgisDocker

I've used this container "as is": [[https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/][Docker Debian]]
There is a (currently embryonic) compose.yml in my configs files

I load with
#+begin_src bash :eval no
docker compose up -d
docker exec -it postgis_container /bin/bash
#+end_src

I then needed to open psql as root (no password)

#+begin_src bash :eval no
psql -U postgres
\du
postgres=# create user pgdocker with password 'pgdocker';
create database official;
postgres=# grant all privileges on database official to pgdocker;
#+end_src

And that seems to give me a pg server.   I also installed psql-client on debian directly. Might want to worry about versions at some stage?


Also, had to manually add the schema
#+begin_src bash :eval no
  psql -U postgres -d official
    postgres=# create schema staging;
    postgres=# create schema ons;
    postgres=# create schema dft;

    alter schema ons owner to pgdocker;
    create extension postgis;
#+end_src
