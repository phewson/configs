As per data team meeting, we are going to record which assumptions we
examined data for, and which we just assumed we knew.  There might be
some granularity such as (a) we have but it's in Mongo and didn't have
the engineering resource (b) we have the data in Big Query but didn't
have time to query it (c) we don't have any data at all but could
collect x and (d) we don't have any data and it's not obvious how we
could have data.

  Thanks Paul — I think that looks good. I'd probably couch the
  request with some words around wanting to understand a bit more
  about how & why the support team are doing that with the field, and
  to explore whether there's a different solution (which is included
  in the note too), but I think the note looks good to be shared with

  Let's wait until later this week when we have more of an idea on the
  groups shaping so far. Then, if there is no other route forwards,
  let's raise a ticket for the basic table here.
- [2023-11-13 Mon 09:34] (comment)
  I think the ticket needs to look like:
  
  As analysts, we need a history of the official group size.  This
  could be as simple as capturing the history from
  analytics.mongo_subscriptions to give us as table that looks like:
  
  admin_id members_limit started_at until Group id Number of members
  allowed in group Date this size applies from Date this size applies
  to (or NULL)
  
  However, it may be considered useful to capture the Recurly
  information as well
  
  admin_id members_limit Recurly_subscription_id plan_code started_at
  until
  
  This may help with the problem we have in group memberships in that
  the group_id and recurly subscription_id look up takes place in a
  separate table.
  
  
  This work is really blocked while we worry about this latter point,
  however, in the meantime we are losing a history of group sizes!

We wish to use a workflow something like (a) Do analysis in R and (b)
move artefacts to Overleaf report template. This means a .tex template
rather than .Rtex which is much easier to use. This also means we can
create a package to routineise some of our work. An MVP package has
been created (calls a standard query for one_week_retention at the
moment).  This is maintained in the git repo and is described in the
wiki.

Changes to the compile timeout have exposed lots more people to the
paywall prompts which has led to an increase in paywall-prompt
events. This was not planned for when budgeting for MixPanel.

Is this going to be a problem? We have been seeing strong MAU growth
this year, and sent a lot of INR events to MixPanel, which may already
both be putting strain on the budget.

Do we need to take any action?

⏳ How does collaborating in Asana save me time?

Tasks and projects in Asana put info about what your team is working
on in one centralized place. You and your team can quickly see where
work is, what decisions have been made, and what steps to take next.

🤔 Where to start?

Add people as collaborators to the tasks and projects you work on, so
they can get automatic updates about the work in their Inbox.

🎮 Try it out!  At the bottom of this task it says
"Collaborators". Right now, you're the only one.

Select an empty circle to search for the name of your manager or a
coworker to add

Complete this task

😎 Pro-tip

When you (or someone else) make a comment or complete a task, all
collaborators will automatically get a notification in their Asana
Inbox.

🤩 You are learning so much!

Next, lets make sure you understand how projects, tasks, and subtasks
fit together to make work manageable.

🌳 Imagine a family tree Projects are at the top of the tree, and are
used to create a plan with many deliverables like a product launch or
a big campaign.

Tasks are in the middle of the tree. Each task represents one thing
that needs to get done.

Subtasks are at the bottom of the tree. Some tasks may need to get
broken down into smaller parts using subtasks.

🎮 Try it out!  Select "+ Add subtask" at the bottom of this task

Give your subtask a name

Complete the subtask

Then, complete this task

😎 Pro-tip

The best tasks have an assignee and a due date. Most tasks can be
completed in a matter of minutes or hours. If a task is going to take
weeks or months, or has no end date, it should be a project.
