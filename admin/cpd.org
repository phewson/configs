** January 2018

*** 17th / 18th. Democratising Data CPD workshop. Coventry UK. :ProfessionalActivity:

Full report available of the proceedings..

- Background reading in preparation for workshop
- Time spent: 5 hours
- Attendance at workshop
- Time spent: 16 hours
- Post workshop write up and subsequent research
- Time spent: 4 hours
- The workshop introduced me to some new datasets that may be useful in understanding road risk.
- Speaking to delegates increased my understanding of what they mean by "data". It isn't necessarily the same as we mean by data. They "think" they want raw data, but lack capacity/tools to process it. However, they don't wish to pay for a constructed dataset, and are very suspicious of standard statistical models.
- In Other words, they don't want a model that delivers results, but would accept the output of a model if it was listed as data.


*** 22nd January Subject Panel :ProfessionalActivity:

- Attendance at University maths exam panel
- Time spent:  6 hours
- Dicussion with academic colleagues, review of student responses. Leads to reflections on the learning process.


*** Consider 3 papers for AA&P, subsequently 2 accepted, one rejected :SelfDirectedLearning:
Time spent: 2 hours 10 mins

** February 2018

*** 27th Feburary Joining the Dots conference :ProfessionalActivity:

- Conference preparation
- Time spent:  3 hours
- Conference attendance
- Time spent:  4 hours (came home early due to snow)
- Post conference evaluation and relfection work
- Time spent:  30 mins
- Required disucssing with colleagues how best to illustrate relevant examples of data fusion with road safety practitioners. Feedback from delegates during the event was analysed afterwards to carefully think about the most immediate examples we can develop.
- A lot of interest in computing road risk, from predicted flows and turn movements.
- Again, no interest in a statistical model, but would be interested in predictions if they were regarded as "data"
- An interesting analogy is the Index of Multiple Deprivation, which is regarded as data but is the output of a statistical process

*** Consider 2 papers for AA&P, subsequently 1 accepted, one rejected :SelfDirectedLearning:
Time spent: 1 hour

** March 2018

*** Webscraping authenticated website. :SelfDirectedLearning:WorkBasedLearning:

Figure how to use requests package to issue autheticated requests via
cookies that have been set.  Learn how to extract data from html tables and send repeated tables into a longitudinal database for subsequent analysis.

- Studying and creating mock servers for authentication
- Time spent:  5 hours
- Researching tools to use for extracting tables from html
- Time spent:  2 hours
- Exploring and evaluating how to use webscapers
- Time spent:  3 hours
- Field testing subsequent visuals with potential end users
- Time spent:  2 hours
- Technically, I understand a lot more about web-scraping authenticated sites
- Most interesting thing is that clients sitting on the data are so used to the summary reports they are
unaware it could be used in different ways. This project was a battle in terms of actually getting the data,
and trying to visualise the possibilities was difficult. However, having shown what you can do, we get a different response.


*** Write professional blogpost (e-bikes) 		 :formal_educational:

- Write a blog post to explain the potential of using spatial generalised additive models
- Data selection, model fittin
- Time spent: 4 hours
- Writing to communciate with non-specialists, reviewing with colleagues/clients and revising
- Time spent: 12 hours
- This is based on a reflection of attending workshops earlier in the year and is an attempt to carry out some novel statistical modelling and indicate to road safety professionals what can be done.
- It has received some good feedback (and a grumpy cyclists using it just to shout at us).
- There is a value in informal methods of communicating the potential of statistical methods.

*** Consider 2 papers for AA&P, subsequently both rejected
- Time spent: 40 mins

** April 2018

*** consider 1 pper for AA&P, subsequently accepted
- Time spent: 1 hour 10 mins

- Time spend: 4 hours

** June 2018


*** 5th June Exeter Analytics Network :ProfessionalActivity:

- Informal networking around analytics hub
- Time spent: 2 hours.
- Exeter College have a degree level apprenticeship in Data Science. Part of the learning will be well controlled hackathons, based on real problems. Need to try to find one to supply.

*** Evise training :formal_educational:

- Essential preparation for using new paper submission system
- Time spent: 1 hour prep
- Time spent: 1 hour 1:1 training session
- Can now use Elseviews new tool

** July 2018

*** 3rd to 7th July Review T-TRIG report

- Reviewing, critiquing and revising extensive report on the use of GPS data and creation of
metrics for network resilience.
- Involved extensive literature review to better situate the work, its limitations.
- Checking code validity, adjusting a few results
- Dicussing report with client stakeholder
- Total time spent with CPD value: 10 hours
- The metrics are out of the comfort zone of end users. We need some way of hand holding them through the logic.
- That might mean getting them to use simple summaries first, and gradually introducing the ideas of expected risk, extreme events and so on.


*** 19th July roads for the future workshop

- Write, submit and present results of SSGP projects
- This project used raw GPS data, as well as providing novel graphical summaries of road sensor data
- Discussion with colleagues and stakeholders to communicate what we were doing
- Visualising a comparison of strategic transport model with evidence from data on the ground
- Responding to stakeholder comments on the likely compliance of the metrics that were developed
- Total time spent with CPD value: 6 hours
- Clients were very defensive of differences between model and actual data
- Clients were very excited about simulations but need reassurance they meet some kind of DfT standard (which doesn't exist). Not sure what to do about this.
- Clients were really excited about insights from data and GPS. Have various leads to follow up
- Our map matching code is too slow, needs to be rewritten for speed.

- Presentation preparation
- Time spent: 5 hours
- Workshop attendance
- Time spent:  8 hours

    :END:

The goal of the project was to deliver a small area forecasting system that could apply the National Trip End Model estimates (NTEM) to smaller areas.
This was done with a Google Sheet which allowed the client to alter the input data (allocate jobs/housing to specific smaller areas than modelled by NTEM).
- Revise usage of Stan for fitting Bayesian models
- Figure out how to use Stan from Python
- Fit and check small area estimation models
- Write report for end user
- Meet end user and discuss feedback

Note: I'm not convinced the client really wanted the ability to alter the input assumptions, they just wanted an "external expert" set of predictions.

   :END:
- This was a stand alone project producing small area estimates from a well established survey.
- The client was Natural England.
- Most of the work is now largely routine to me.
- However, there was HUGE CPD value in that we had a very open discussion about the interpretation of the results. This provided me with a very clear idea of the level of understanding of those who have to interpret/defend the results, and their willingness to understand. I wrote some appendices explaining interpretation and they were very happy with these. I have had many client who don't want results that need work on their part to understand, which can limit the support you can offer. That was not the case in this instance.

    :END:
 - There are a range of black / grey models used to estimate HTC
 - I have sketched (in Python) one method that estimate HTC based on changepoint regression.
 - Other models require estimates of dynamical systems, this is a little outside my expertise and I have reported this.
