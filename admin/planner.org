- Meeting with Brittany
- Agreed to invite me to future meetings/stand up
- I didn't understand the coherence of the planning document (reducing pdfs, using Overleaf pdf viewer) and the relationship to the proposed events
- Brittany emphasised this is a low risk feature roll out - it sounds like a typical engineering make available to beta and if no-one complains then roll to all. So the success factor is really that the feature works as designed and no-one complains.
- As a side note, it seems to add functionality already available in the website pdf viewer
- The presentation mode is separate. We should monitor how much use that gets, and people's reaction to it

*** Support 15th May

- Support allocations sorted
- Overleaf connection test page would be helpful, D MacK would like more than websocket tests
- Git integration - have I been pawned delivers 500 error, should we stop encouraging password access to git. JLM thinks work is done, we just need to flip the switch (gradually, to limit support demand)
- Updating based on CTAN content e.g. mapping of packages and functions e.g. for auto complete. Time to update mapping? Commands, environments and packages themselves).  e.g DTX generates code and docs

*** Support 29th May
- 503 git errors, google suggest something to do with VPNs
- Readcube integration - lots of concern that they aren't very good at LaTeX
